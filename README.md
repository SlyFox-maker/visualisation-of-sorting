# visualisation-of-sorting
Hi every one! This will be my first repository. You are welcome if you see some not good stafs in my code. I'm will accept all criticism from you(criticism, not insults).
I was inspired by numerous videos on youtube visualizing array sorting. 
Idea of this programm was in that, what you can make any script in python, upload that in my programm and test that! Obviously for make it for you must do some things in your python script.


# Manual

For make your script work - you must write all history of actions in your array sorting. For that you must use arrHistory = [array, i, x](examples in folder of dones script).

- array - it's your array wich was changed
- i - first position of element for replace second element
- x - second position of element
