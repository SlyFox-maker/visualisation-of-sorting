# visualisation-of-sorting
Hi every one! This will be my first repository. You are welcome if you see some not good stafs in my code. I'm will accept all criticism from you(criticism, not insults).
I was inspired by numerous [videos]([https://youtu.be/i5VIOPaU6Xw](https://youtu.be/kPRA0W1kECg) "random example") on youtube visualizing array sorting. 
Idea of this programm was in that, what you can make any script in python, upload that in my programm and test that! Obviously for make it for you must do some things in your python script.


# Manual

For make your script work - you must write all history of actions in your array sorting. For that you must use arrHistory = [array, i, x](examples in folder of dones script).

- array - it's your array wich was changed
- i - first position of element for replace second element
- x - second position of element

# adding Scripts

Well, when you made a script - you must save that in folder "algorithms". After that you must enter to the programm and push in comboBox button "Update...". After all this action you can see your script in the same ComboBox.

# Use

And the things that easy for understant without manual, but I will write that anyways. 

- numericUpDown1 - this element for install wigth of your array.
- numericUpDown2 - this element for install delay of sorting.
- button "start" - just for start process. It's desable when you don't painted array.
- button "draw Array" - for make and paint your new array.
